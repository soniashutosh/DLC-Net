# DLCNet for Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification

## Abstract

**An optimized deeper lightweight convolutional neural network architecture for early plant leaves disease detection and classification is proposed in this paper.Plants are highly susceptible to leaf diseases varying from plant to plant. Symptoms of most of the disease are early recognisable and non-differentiable in early stages. Current research presents a solution through deep learning so the plants health can be monitored and if required cure will be given, it will lead to an increase in the quality as well as the better crop production.Proposed model used point-wise and separable convolution block for reducing number of trainable parameters and more connectivity between layers for alleviating the vanishing gradient problem,strengthen feature propagation and motivating feature reusing. Proposed architecture achieved better accuracy on plants tested as well as able to reduce number of trainable parameters compared to Densenet, Resnet, VGG, Alexnet, Xception-network and many more on several metric like number of trainable parameters and classification metrics.**
